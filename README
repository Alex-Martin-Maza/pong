# PONG

This is a recreation of the classic pong video game. Imlimented in the C
programming language, using SDL libary to display graphics on the screen.

To compile using the GCC compiler (must have the SDL libraries installed) and
available in the operating systems PATH environment variable
`gcc pong.c -lSDL -o pong`

it should compile fine on Linux, Windows and Mac.  
This has been tested on Linux and compiles without error.

## Controls
* use the keyboard arrow keys to move up and down.
* space bar starts a game from the menu screen.
* ESC exits the program.
